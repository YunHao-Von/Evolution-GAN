This is an improved generated adversarial  network based on evolutionary network.  
It is mainly based on a paper called *Skilful nowcasting of extreme precipitation with NowcastNet*.    
Climate data sets from Nanjing University are needed(It is the based dataset).  
Our system is Ubuntu22.04 and Nvidia V100 graphics chip.
